Feed Reader Testing
===============================

The task was to use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How to use the application?

Simply use the [application online](http://thomasbergernz.github.io/turnt-octo-computing-machine), or 
[download](https://github.com/thomasbergernz/turnt-octo-computing-machine/archive/master.zip) to your computer and expand the ZIP archive.
Open the included 'index.html' file in a web browser.
